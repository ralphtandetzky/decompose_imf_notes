Ideas for improving the total result
====================================
* Find one or several reasonable initial approximations of a solution
    - Find extrema between zeros and interpolate between them for an
        inital approximation
    - Possibly it makes sense to interpolate the zeros as well
    - Erase zeros, if they are located to close to each other
    - Make sure that boundary conditions are fulfilled automatically
        (erasing zeros might actually help here)
	
* Use a different base for the functions to get better locality characteristics
    - Try a wavelet base.
    - For the imaginary part use a base of monotonic functions satisfying the
        boundary conditions
	
* Combine the boundary conditions
    $|\tau_i-\tau_{i+1}| \le \min\{ (\Im\tau_j)^2,(\Im\tau_{j+1})^2 \}$ and
    $0 \le \Im\tau_j$ into one:
    $$ |\tau_i-\tau_{i+1}|
    \le \max\{ 0, \min\{ \Im\tau_j,\Im\tau_{j+1} \} \}^2 $$
	
* Allow phase-boost under certain circumstances
    - If there is a big enough decreasing jump of the phase then a phase boost
        may be applied.
	
* Avoid negative phase velocity
    - Under some circumstances the fitted solutions have negative phase
    velocity over a few samples. Often these samples could be replaced with
    other values giving an almost identical function $a_i(t)\cos\varphi_i(t)$.
    The idea behind that is very simple: The cosine is an even function.
    Hence pieces with negative phase velocity could be replaced by the
    negative of the original phase plus an integer multiple of $2\pi$.
	

Things to do on the gui
=======================
* Let the user choose the noise level to be added to the initial
    approximation
* Let the user choose the parameters of the target function
* Let the user choose whether only the phase shall be fitted or both phase
    and amplitude shall be fitted
    

Test functions for optimization tests
=====================================
4.5*sin(x+2)+sin(5*x+1)+sin(19*x)/3
4*sin((x*x+x)/2+2)+sin(16*x)
sin(x*x+x+1)*(3-x/3)+sin(20*x)*(0.4+0.1*x)
sin(exp(x*0.6))*(7-x)
sin(10*x+sin(3*x))*3
3.4*sin(2*x)+3*sin(31*x)
sin(exp(x*0.65))*(7-x)+2*sin(10*x+1)

To do for scientific work
=========================
* Nullstellen in den Griff bekommen
* Korrespondenzproblem und Mode-Mixing untersuchen
* Benchmark mit Funktionen von Rudin
